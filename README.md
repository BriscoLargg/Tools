# Tools

A git submodule that contains a bunch of useful C#/Unity3D code. 

The idea is to keep inside the git submodule a core generic code such as patterns 
or tools used across different projects and not reinvent the wheel every time a project starts. 
It also can sync with all projects once updated.
